# Store1337-SSR

**This is an ejected project of CRA for which I configured webpack by myself.**
* To start the project do:
    * npm init 
    * npm run-script build:all
*  To run the project simply CD to dist and do:
    * npm run-script start:server
*  To only run react without SSR do: 
    * npm start
